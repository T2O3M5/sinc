<h2>Concepts of a webpage/webapplication are based on...</h2>

<p>1)Connecting to Internet</p>
<p>First, your computer needs to connect to the internet.</p>

<p>It does this through the Network Interface Card, "NIC", inside your computer.</p>

<p>The "NIC" is the connection point, or "interface"; from your computer to an "external", "network".</p>

<p>A "router" is used to connect this "external network" to the "internet".</p>

<p>Your computer is now "connected" to the "internet".</p><br>


<p>2)Definig the Domain Name/URL for your browser to display...</p>
<p>In your browser, you type "webpage.com + ENTER" for the webpage you would like to see.</p>

<p>When you clicked ENTER, you tell your "browser program" (ie Chrome, Internet Explorer, Mozilla, etc...) to "find" the "host server" for webpage.com; which means...</p><br>

<p>3)Finding the Host Server from the Browser</p>
<p>The "browser program" sends the "human readable text", webpage.com, to your computers "NIC"(Network Interface Card) asking the NIC to retrieve the "content" for webpage.com, from the "external network".</p>

<p>The "NIC" will need to find "where" in the "external network", webpage.com is located.</p>

<p>The "NIC" sends a "request" to the "Router" asking for the location (or "ip address") of the "host server", for webpage.com.</p><br>

<p>4)If the router can't find it...</p>
<p>If the "Router" doesn't know what the "host server" "ip address" is; the "Router" will "request" the "ip address", for the "host server" of webpage.com, "from" a public "Domain Name Server" (DNS).</p>

<p>A web "Router" is always "configured/programmed" with default "IP addresse(s)" defining where to send "DNS requests".</p>

<p>The "DNS" is another computer or "server";</p>  

<p>Each of these DNS contain "tables", which connect a human readable "Domain Name" with an "IP address".</p>

<p>Every "Domain Name" is unique, and the "Domain Name Server" is where a "Domain Name, URL," is stored with a "computer readable", "ip address".</p>

<p>The "DNS" sends the "IP address", of the "host server", that holds the "content", for webpage.com, back to your "machine".</p>

<p>Your machine now knows where to send the request for the "content" of webpage.com.</p><br>


<p>5) Retrieve information from the "host server"</p>

<p>Now similarly to the DNS "ip request"; the "Browser","NIC", and "External Network" will work together again, to "request" the "_content" from the "host _server_"; instead of "requesting" the "_ip address" for from the "domain name _server_".</p>

<p>The "host server" "recieves" the "request" for this page. The "Operating System"(OS) for the "host server", will search its "disk space" to find where webpage.com "content files" are located in the "host server".</p>

<p>Now that the "host server" has located the files for this "domain", the "host server" "OS",  will responde to the request with a copy of the file, that is "programmed" or "configured" to be sent, in response to a request for webpage.com.</p>

<p>The webpage.com "home page" is sent back to your browser.</p><br>

<p>6) Once retrieved and in your browser...</p>

<p>Your browser opens the "home page".</p>

<p>The "home page" is the "content file"</p>

<p>This "content file" tells your browser "what" to show, and "Paths" showing "where" the "browser" should load the "reference files" from.</p>

<p>The "Paths" usually display the location on the "host server" OR a "url/link" to another webserver.</p>

<p>Once loaded, the "Reference files" can be used to tell the browser how the page will look (fonts, colors, backgroud, etc) and how the page is supposed to "operate" (without talking to the server).</p>

<p>The "operate", "reference file" which is "loaded" to the "browser", "controls" how the "browser" interacts with the "home page".</p> 

<p>These "control" programs do not need to talk to the "server/database". Once "loaded" in the "browser", the web page "displays content" can change, depending on your interaction with the page, and how these "control programs" tell the page to respond.</p>

<p>You now have a interactive web page on your browser.</p><br>

<p>7) The "packets" of "data" that are sent between "machines" is the overall concept of the internet. One machine passes data to another machine.</p><br>

<p>8) Each "machine" holds its own "OS program", that controls "what" the machine does, with the "data" stored on the "machine".</p><br>

<p>9) There are various inputs, (usb, speakers, etc) but the "NIC" allows the machine to connect to the "cloud"; which consists of this whole concept, for every "NIC", on a "machine", "connected" to the "internet/cloud", in the world.</p><br>

<p>10) Look up the "code" for an "html" s page, copy this into a text file. Insert comments as you'd like. Save as something.html and click to open the file. Your machine is configured to open html files with the default "browser" on your "machine."</p><br>
